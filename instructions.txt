Copy the script with the DS.7.x.zip file in the same dir
chmod the script like: chmod 755 repDS.sh to make it executable.


Edit the script and at the top section #settings change settings
to meet your installation requirements if needed.


Execute the script with argument a number of DS to deploy like:
repDS.sh 4
This will create 4 DS servers and at the end will execute
the dsrepl init. There is a soft limit for min and max servers to
deploy min=2 max=8 (can be changed)


The Installation will check if appropriate Java is installed,
create directories and check if already exist, create all ports,
and check the OS for port conflicts. On the first deployed DS
installation directory two txt files will be created one
with the DEPLOYMENT_KEY and one with all installation
commands used.

Default:
--deploymentKeyPassword Password1
--rootUserDN uid=admin
--rootUserPassword Password1
--monitorUserPassword Password1
--profile ds-evaluation
--set ds-evaluation/generatedUsers:100 

Server id will be in the format MASTER0, MASTER1 MASTER2...
Destination path will be in the format /opt/ds7xRepl0, /opt/ds7xRepl1, /opt/ds7xRepl2, /opt/ds7xRepl3, /opt/ds7xReplx ...

Default ports to be used:
ldap: 1389 for each additional server +1 ie. second server 1390 third 1391 etc
ldaps: 1636 for each additional server +1 (1637,1638...)
admin: 4444 for each additional server +1 (4445, 4446..)
replication: 8989 for each additional server +1 (8990, 8991..)
